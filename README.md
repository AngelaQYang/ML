# Self Study
This is a repository just for fun-study time. It doesn't associate with any project I did with my employer. :) 

# Data Sources & Assignments
All data here are from Kaggle or various public agency websites. 
All assignments are from casebooks, data challenges, online courses, and great examples I found. 

# “Never Pass Life in Vain” 
"Never pass life in vain" is the quote I wrote on my high school notebook, for whole three years. Even I try very hard find meaningful manners in everything; I did pass life in vain (up to how to define it) on many occasions :)  

Same as the projects I worked. Have you ever spend lots time on training models but later regret on all-time invests. (you know what I am saying.) Sure we all did. I have lots of regrets, especially on research projects which didn’t set up firm landmarks. Moreover, I found myself lost a little bit on the model twisting process, regret not giving enough time to deep dive into data itself. The more modeling I have done, more I came across the thoughts "huh, I should look into that feature more” “how come I didn't wipe out this at the beginning?" “How much is my data biased?!” 

Finally, I want to do some self-study and fun exploration of the data itself. I want to know more, familiar with more tools before build more. Here I am. Don't want to pass life in vain, want to target goals by utilizing tools and data more wisely.
