U.S. Male median income increased since 2010. For example, from 2010 to 2012, the median income has increase $700.
However, the median income trend for'less than high school graduate' subgroup has been decreased. For example 2010 has higher median income than 2012's. The income comparison table is listed below. 

The reason is the simpson paradox. 
Even though 'less than high school graduate' subgroup median income has been decreased, more people earning higher degrees than high school graduate. So, with more population shift to the higher degree, the median income has risen.
